## Purpose
Have you ever needed to make a Dungeons and Dragons character on the fly? Well look no further! Making a new character to play with can take quite a bit of time and who has time to waste when you just want to play. This app allows users to easily create new characters fast with generated stats that would meet all the criteria needed to start or jump into a campaign!

## Features 

![image of app](public/images/characterStats.png)
Once you have selected the proper fields to create your character an easy to read and understand stat page is generated. Hovering over a certain stat/trait will generate a small text box describing the individual stat or trait. This makes for easy understanding to even the most beginner player.

Want to create more than one character? Not a problem! An easy to view page allows the user to see all the characters they have created. A simple click will send you right to that characters stats page.
